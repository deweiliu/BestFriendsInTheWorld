    <p>This project is using multiple servers and their intergration based on Microsoft Azure Cloud Service, including
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/app-service/web/"> Web App</a>, 
   <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_SQL_Server"> SQL Database</a>,
    <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/bot-service/"> Azure Bot service (Direct Line API) </a> and 
    <a href="https://www.qnamaker.ai/">QnAMaker</a>. All of these servers are hosted on Azure Web App service, and this app is using Django Framework written in Python 3.
    Clients can only contact the app so other servers are hidden from clients. This makes sure that other servers are in safe and won't get exposed in public.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> <strong>Because of our limited budget, the performance of the servers is quite low, so please be paitent to the delays while you are using the app.</strong></p>

    <h4>Please see bellow the images to see how it works step by step.</h4>

        <h3>Login page</h3>
        <p>When you log in with your first name and surname, the app checks if you are a registered user by checking your name.
        <ul>If it is, it redirects you to an URL with your user ID number.</ul>
        <ul>If it is not, it assign you a new user ID and redirects you to an URL with your user ID number.</ul>

        <h3>Starting the conversation</h3>
        <p>The app then receives the URL with your user ID. It queries the SQL database for your details and chatting history. 
        Then it shows you the AI dialog and your previous messages (if any). 
        At the same time, the app send HTTP request to The Azure Bot to start a conversation with your bot credentials.
        <br/><strong>Note, the bot credentials are used for accessing the bot and identifing which messages are from a same conversation/user. These are required by "Direct Line API", and not controlled by you. (not your login details)</strong></p>

        <ul><h3>Sending a message</h3>
            <li><strong>Client side (your browser)</strong>: sends a message to the app, and keeps sending HTTP request to ask if there are new messages updated.</li>
            <li><strong>App side</strong>: lodges the message to database, restructures the message, and sends it to the Bot.</li>
            <li><strong>Azure Bot</strong>: Asks the QnAMaker to find a question from knowledge base that matches the question asked by the user, and temporaryly stores the answer.</li>

                      2. Keeps asking the Bot if the answer is ready. Once the answer is ready, lodges the answer to the database.</li>
